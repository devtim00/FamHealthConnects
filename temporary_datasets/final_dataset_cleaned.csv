While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.

Her right second and third toes lay on each other.  Also the same on her left foot.  However there was no skin breakdown.  She had large bunions medial aspect of the ball of both feet.  She had positive sensitivity to most areas of her feet however she had negative sensitivity to the medial and lateral aspect of the balls of her left foot.During the education session she set behavioral goals for self care.  First goal is to eat three meals a day and eat three snacks daily to improve her blood glucose levels.  Second goal is to eat a well balanced meal at 1200 calories in order to lose one-half pound of weight per week and improve her blood glucose control.  Third goal is to exercise by walking for 15 to 30 minutes a day three to five days a week to increase her blood glucose control.  Her success in achieving these goals will be followed in three months by a letter from the diabetes education class.RECOMMENDATIONS:  Since she is doing so well with her diet changes her blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side especially considering the fact that she has low blood sugar unawareness.

"40305";" Psychological Testing for ADHD";"ASSESSMENT RESULTS:  Mr. Abcds responses to a brief self-report instrument given to him by Dr. Starks was suggestive of symptoms that could be consistent with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  I therefore had him complete the Conners CPT-II which showed good performance and no indications of attention problems.  The Confidence Index associated with ADHD was over 58 percent that no clinical attention problems are present.  While a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder should not unequivocally be ruled out based on the results of this test there is nothing in the CPT-II measures indicating attention problems and that diagnosis appears to be unlikely.  The MMPI-2 profile is a technically valid and interpretable one.  The Modified Welsh Code is as follows:  49+86-231/570:  F+-/:LK#.  The high F scale may reflect some moodiness restlessness dissatisfaction and changeableness in his typical behavior.  The Basic Clinical Profile is similar to persons who tend to get into trouble for violating social norms and rules.  Such persons are more likely to experience conflicts with authority.  They also are prone to impulsivity self-indulgence problems with delay of gratification exercise problematic judgment and often have low frustration tolerance.  Those with similar scores tend to be moody irritable extraverted and often do not trust others very much.  Mr. Abcd may tend to keep others at a distance yet feel rather insecure and dependent.  A bipolar diagnosis is a possibility and an antisocial personality disorder cannot be entirely ruled out either though I am less confident that that is correct.  The MMPI-2 Content Scale scores indicate some mild depression and family stressors and the Supplementary Scales has a single clinical elevation on Addiction Admission which is entirely consistent with his interview data.

If further spells are noted we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day.3.  I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings.  EEG hopefully will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results.

Chronic otitis media due to a penicillin resistant organism would be the obvious diagnosis in this case.  It is rare for an adolescent to have otitis media with no precipitating factor (such as being on a swim team or otherwise exposed to unusual organisms or in an unusual environment).  It is certainly unusual for him to have three episodes in 1 year.PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE.  There were no symptoms of peptic ulcer disease a negative H. pylori screen and lack of pain made this diagnosis less likely.  Trauma.  Trauma was a possibility particularly since adolescent males frequently minimize symptoms especially if they might limit participation in a sport but patient maintained that he had not had an event where he struck his head or neck and that he always wore his helmet with ear padding.GERD.  The history of heartburn relieved by his fathers medication was striking.

His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.

The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together 2% impairment of the upper extremity.

She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.

The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment Fifth Edition stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.";"Sure!

Two-hour postprandial breakfast reading was 105 two-hour postprandial lunch reading was 88 and two-hour postprandial dinner reading was 73 and 63.  Her diet was excellent.Seven hours of counseling about diabetes mellitus was provided on this date.Blood glucose values obtained at 10 a.m. were 84 and at 2.30 p.m. were 109.  Assessment of her knowledge is completed at the end of the counseling session.  She demonstrated increased knowledge in all areas and had no further questions.  She also completed an evaluation of the class.The patients feet were examined during the education session.  She had flat feet bilaterally.  Skin color was pink temperature warm.  Pedal pulses 2+.  Her right second and third toes lay on each other.  Also the same on her left foot.  However there was no skin breakdown.  She had large bunions medial aspect of the ball of both feet.  She had positive sensitivity to most areas of her feet however she had negative sensitivity to the medial and lateral aspect of the balls of her left foot.During the education session she set behavioral goals for self care.  First goal is to eat three meals a day and eat three snacks daily to improve her blood glucose levels.  Second goal is to eat a well balanced meal at 1200 calories in order to lose one-half pound of weight per week and improve her blood glucose control.  Third goal is to exercise by walking for 15 to 30 minutes a day three to five days a week to increase her blood glucose control.  Her success in achieving these goals will be followed in three months by a letter from the diabetes education class.RECOMMENDATIONS:  Since she is doing so well with her diet changes her blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side especially considering the fact that she has low blood sugar unawareness.

We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.

She has been treated with prednisone as in the beginning she had also a wrist and ankle discomfort and high inflammatory markers.  Since I took over her care I have not seen a clear-cut erythema nodosum being present.  No evidence of synovitis was there.  Her serologies apart from an ANA of 1:40 were negative.  She has a livedo pattern which has been worrisome.  The issue here was a possibility of inflammatory bowel disease based on deficiency in vitamin B12 as indicated by high methylmalonic and homocystine levels and also iron deficiency.  She also has low vitamin D levels which point towards terminal ileum pathology as well and she had a history of decreased MCV.  We never received the x-ray of her hands which she had and she never had a DEXA scan.  Lymphoma has been ruled out and we believe that inflammatory bowel disease after repeated colonoscopies and the capsule endoscopy has been ruled out as well.  Sarcoid is probably not the case since the patient did not have any lymphadenopathies and her ACE levels were normal.  We are going check a PPD to rule out tuberculosis.  We are going to order an RVVT and glycoprotein beta-1 levels in her workup to make sure that an antiphospholipid syndrome is not present given the livedo pattern.  An anti-intrinsic factor will be added as well.  Her primary care physician needs to workup the possible B12 and iron deficiency and also the vitamin D deficiency.  In the meanwhile we feel that the patient should stop taking the colchicine and if she has a flare of her disease then she should present to her dermatologist and have the skin biopsy performed in order to have a clear-cut answer of what is the nature of this skin rash.  Regarding her heart murmur we are going to proceed with an echocardiogram.  A PPD should be placed as well.  In her next appointment we may fax a requisition for vitamin B replacement.PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:  1.  Recurrent erythema nodosum with ankle and wrist discomfort ? arthritis.2.

The patient also has significant acidosis and his creatinine has increased from 2.1 to 4.2 overnight.  Given the fact that he would need dialytic support for his electrolyte derangements and for volume control I would suggest continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration as opposed to conventional hemodialysis as the patient will not be able to tolerate conventional hemodialysis given his hemodynamic instability.2.

His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves.  He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks.I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial.  He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy.  He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea.  Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen.RECOMMENDATIONS:1.  I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy.2.  I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Zs opinion that there is no surgical indication.3.  I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain.4.  I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression.  It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist.  The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion.5.  He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled.

The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02.  For her suprascapular neuropathy she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit.  This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together 2% impairment of the upper extremity.  For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction.  She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension.  There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation.  She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation.  Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity.  This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment Fifth Edition stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.";"The patient has a problem with their right shoulder called impingement syndrome.

Since I took over her care I have not seen a clear-cut erythema nodosum being present.  No evidence of synovitis was there.  Her serologies apart from an ANA of 1:40 were negative.  She has a livedo pattern which has been worrisome.  The issue here was a possibility of inflammatory bowel disease based on deficiency in vitamin B12 as indicated by high methylmalonic and homocystine levels and also iron deficiency.  She also has low vitamin D levels which point towards terminal ileum pathology as well and she had a history of decreased MCV.  We never received the x-ray of her hands which she had and she never had a DEXA scan.  Lymphoma has been ruled out and we believe that inflammatory bowel disease after repeated colonoscopies and the capsule endoscopy has been ruled out as well.  Sarcoid is probably not the case since the patient did not have any lymphadenopathies and her ACE levels were normal.  We are going check a PPD to rule out tuberculosis.  We are going to order an RVVT and glycoprotein beta-1 levels in her workup to make sure that an antiphospholipid syndrome is not present given the livedo pattern.  An anti-intrinsic factor will be added as well.  Her primary care physician needs to workup the possible B12 and iron deficiency and also the vitamin D deficiency.  In the meanwhile we feel that the patient should stop taking the colchicine and if she has a flare of her disease then she should present to her dermatologist and have the skin biopsy performed in order to have a clear-cut answer of what is the nature of this skin rash.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  It is unknown if this is a new onset versus a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Given the patient has a recurrent stroke anticoagulation with Coumadin to prevent further stroke is indicated.  However given the patients current neurologic status the safety of falling is unclear.  We need to further discuss with the patients primary care physician probably rehab physician.  If the patients risk of falling is low then Coumadin is indicated.  However if the patients risk for falling is high then a course using aspirin and Plavix will be recommended.  Transesophageal echocardiogram probably will delineate possible intracardiac thrombus better however will not change our current management.  Therefore I will not recommend transesophageal echocardiogram at this point.  Currently the patients heart rate is well controlled antiarrhythmic agent is not recommended at this point.2.  Carotid artery stenosis.  The patient underwent a carotid Doppler ultrasound on this admission and found to have a high-grade increased velocity of the right internal carotid artery.
